# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-with-BERT

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets using pre-trained BERT and RoBERTa models. It involves processing tweets, cleaning the text, tokenizing it, and fine-tuning a transformer-based model to predict sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Clean tweets by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and emojis. Tokenize the cleaned tweets using the respective tokenizers for BERT or RoBERTa.
Model Training: Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT or RoBERTa model on a labeled dataset of tweets.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Inference: Use the trained model to classify the sentiment of new tweets.
Technologies:

Libraries: transformers, torch, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib.
Models: BERT and RoBERTa for natural language processing and sentiment classification.
Outcome: This project demonstrates how transformer models can be used to accurately predict the sentiment of social media content like tweets.
